**Problem**: Forecasting Employee Attrition Risk

**Significance**: Companies need to predict which employees are likely to resign to optimize human resource management. Organizations typically invest in employee training to enhance productivity and performance. However, selecting the right individuals for intensive development is crucial. While choosing wisely can yield significant benefits, investing in employees who are likely to leave in the near future can result in wasted resources. Moreover, companies face a greater risk when they inadvertently train exceptional employees for their competitors. Therefore, it's essential for organizations to identify employees with a lower likelihood of resignation for more focused development.
